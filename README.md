# Metis_MTA_EDA_Project

The goal of this project was to use the New York MTA Turnstiles to analyze traffic at
certain stations targeting our demographics of gamers, students, and working
professionals in order to promote a gaming event hosted by the esports team Cheetah.

Traffic is analyzed between June and November to predict optimal placements of electronic
advertisements at stations during specific hours. After pinpointing stations that will have
most of our target demographic going through, I provide the traffic of the top five
stations with the most traffic and communicate my results using matplotlib and seaborn.
